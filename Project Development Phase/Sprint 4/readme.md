<b>NOTE: We had the SendGrid api key in this file as text, that have been detected by SendGrid team as the key was published publicly and deactivated the key. We did the project with another api key. To avoid this issue being repeated again, we have removed the api key and also attached that ticket mail raised by SendGrid team. 
  
  Thank you for your understanding.<b>
